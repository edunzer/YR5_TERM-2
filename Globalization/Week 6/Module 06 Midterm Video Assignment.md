## MODULE 06 MIDTERM VIDEO ASSIGNMENT

Your video should include several elements: 

First, what definition of globalization is on display in this video? 

    Its relatively clear that the definition that the video uses the most is "Internationalization" solely because so much of the documentary talks in terms of country. All parts of globalization are dealt with through the country in which to people demonstrated are living. The narrator even states how the government or country was the one that allowed globalization to occur. 

    There are also subtle elements of westernization in the film as well. The narrator states that because of the westernized ideas of democracy and freedom many countries have completely changed there ideas of globalization and trade. Many countries that used to have no large trade outside of farming now have large trade with countries like the US which has helped them to advance past farming. 

Second, analyze Norberg's argument in terms of the theories presented in Chapter 4 of your text. Which mode of explanation is Norberg using? How do his film-making choices (examples, claims, suggestions) demonstrate this view of globalization? 

    The ideas of progress are also presented in the film as Political Realism which is one of the main theories used. One of the main ideas of the film is that because of the competitive wage markets for labor in some of these countries many economies have been strengthened. Taiwan being the main example where many of its citizens who choose to move from farming to factory work have increased there living standards.  

    But there is also subtle elements of Marxism throughout where the narrator suggests that because of the new globalized nations there has been an increase equal worker living and wage standards. This of course isn't perfect Marxism since other people in the country like farmers are left out but it does demonstrate a type of equal distribution where because the economic development a equitable distribution of resources is spread through the industrial working population. 

Third, reframe one of Norberg's scenes using another explanatory framework. That is, what choices would you as filmmaker make if you wanted to represent a Marxist, Political Realist, Feminist, etc, point of view? For example, how would a Feminist filmmaker present the case of the Nike factory in Vietnam? (this is just an example, you may choose to "reframe" any scene from the movie). What would you show, what claims or arguments would you make if had an agenda different from Norberg's?
