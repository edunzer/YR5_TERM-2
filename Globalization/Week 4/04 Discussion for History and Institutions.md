## 04 DISCUSSION FOR HISTORY AND INSTITUTIONS

Two key starters to consider 

1) What was your take on the different approaches to history?

As I stated in my written assignment the two approaches were relatively the same while sharing completely different points of view. Both were very clearly pushing there view that globalization was either positive or negative. The text manages to do so a little more elegantly then the documentary which just leaves out all positive aspects and pushes only the negatives. The text also provides evidence of why there arguments make sense and what possible counters there could been, while the documentary just keeps pushing "emotion triggers" to try and overpower more solid and foundational arguments. 

2) What have you learned about the BIG 3 (IMF, WB, WTO) which jumped out at you as particularly important or revealing about these institutions?

I had a limited understanding of what they all were. I certainly new more about WTO then any of the others, but overall I still got a good understanding of what they are doing in the world and how they are currently working. I think it was definitely clear that the main opposition for all the organizations is that they tend to give more power to the countries and groups that have more pull in the economy. Although this does make sense in some scenarios it seems to defeat the purpose of the organizations. All of which were developed to help countries that needed it and despite the fact that they are helping there seems to be lots of limits because of larger country involvement.
