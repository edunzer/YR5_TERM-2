## 09 DISCUSSION FOR SOVEREIGNTY

By now you should have strong understanding of sovereignty including what it is, what changes it is undergoing, what alternative forms of power are developing under conditions of globalization. Bring all this knowledge into the discussion. 

Choose one of the following for your original post, choose the other topic for your reply.

1.  Analyze the "Shrunken Sovereignty" article using the knowledge (and vocabulary) you've gained from Scholte and earlier sections of this course.  Clearly, you can't do it all in a single discussion post, so just pick a part of it.   Note: analysis does not mean writing "I liked/hated it"

2.  You have read many web-based articles so far in this class - several of them can be related to issues of sovereignty.  Demonstrate your ability to connect the course content by bringing something from a previous module into your discussion.
