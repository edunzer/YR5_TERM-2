Who makes its rules?

How might globalization impact your chosen career?
- It severally increases the chances and abilities that I have to find a new job if I would want one. My career is extremely flexible on location and can be done from anywhere along with being supported by other employees form anywhere as well. There has also been an increased need for my desired skill set because of the increase of globalization where information needs to be available anywhere.
