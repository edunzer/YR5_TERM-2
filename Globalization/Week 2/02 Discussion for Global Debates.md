## 02 DISCUSSION FOR GLOBAL DEBATES

Choose one of the written assignment questions to which to respond.

What's your answer? (try to use your own words)

More importantly, what questions did it raise in your mind (either in terms of its language or its relevance to something in the "real world")? 

`Scholte argues that we need a clear idea of what “globalization” is and isn’t.  Why is this important?`

- As shown in the other ways of looking at globalization in the assignment when a definition becomes swayed in a certain direction not only does it become unclear, but it also sometimes moves away from the original meaning of the word. Instead of focusing on only a single issue the definition needs to encompasses all of the issues that globalization would deal with.

- This problem not only makes me think that creating a single definition would possibly limit the amount of information that can be conveyed but also that it could lead to assumptions that are made by users. Much like in many religious texts where inferences are made without concrete evidence anywhere else in the text. This could create factions of people that think that the singular term means different things and can support different processes of thought.  

- This thought makes me go back and forth on whether having having just a singular definition of something can cause more harm then good. Since it can largely depending on the time it was created and the people that were creating it.
