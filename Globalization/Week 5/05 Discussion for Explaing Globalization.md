## 05 DISCUSSION FOR EXPLAINING GLOBALIZATION

In this discussion I would like you to talk about the theories and forces Scholte provides in this chapter. NOTE: This does NOT mean cutting and pasting from your written work 

Instead, I'd like you to think back to the various web links and the film you've already read and the film "End of Poverty" and consider which theoretical orientation explains that event or story best. Lay out the key elements of the piece and demonstrate how a particular theory (explanatory framework) applies.  Keep in mind, a single piece may be explained with several frameworks so see how many you can apply. 

In the "We are the people" web-link there is really only one apparent force that is addressed. Identify. The entire video/song is about similarity and humanity recognizing that they have common traits regardless of racial identity or ethnicity. The video was almost the complete opposite of the "End of Poverty" video.

The first key theoretical approach in the "End of Poverty" film being postmodernism. Where the theory looks at how structural power of significant social constructions such as culture and language of different nations across the world work to form the boundaries and limits. As Im sure we can all agree the film was nothing but the demonstration of power of some over others so the theory does a great job of defining what kind of globalization framework was used. 

Also another key theory that was used in the film was Constructivism which works to explain how the different cultural and social impacts of other effects your perspective. This was obvious in the film when they showed history of the early ages where colonialism took over and colonizing bodies basically "taught" indigenous people incorrect logic about land ownership and duty to the colonizing nation.
