## FILM ANALYSIS DISCUSSION

You've just watched two films.  The Global Assembly Line and 1-800-INDIA, which take very different approaches to understanding globalization.

In your written assignments, I asked you to identify the definition and theory of each.   For this discussion I want you to pick one of the films and present your interpretation.   Respond to others and start a conversations.   These films are not as clear cut as Globalization is Good, so there will be plenty of opportunity to test ideas against each other. 

Keep in mind, we want to identify the perspective of the film makers.  I'm sure you can all re-interpret these films from a variety of perspectives, but what were the film makers trying to convey?

Analysis of the film: The Global Assembly Line

Much like some of the previous films this documentary uses the definition of Internationalization. Much of the film details the differences that come from the borders and countries that are assembled around the world. All parts of globalization are dealt with through the country in which to people demonstrated are living. The contrasts and similarities are detailed between different countries in order to show how globalization has affected both of them. 

There are also elements of westernization and modernization. Most notably of which is the use of democracy and equality that has been fought for in western societies. This is show in the film as protests, unions, etc. all of which seemed to be adopted by the countries trying to improve there working conditions. There were also elements of feminism which although not the main purpose of the film did work to show how female workers have been cast into the low labor factory market in many of the countries being affected by globalization. 

What I did find interesting in this film vs past films that had a similar perspective is that it showed the compounded effects that happen with globalization on both countries. On one hand it showed that the US citizens were losing their jobs and on the other it showed other countries gaining jobs. This film almost seemed to give an equal perspective on the issue, at least more than the other which were one sided.
