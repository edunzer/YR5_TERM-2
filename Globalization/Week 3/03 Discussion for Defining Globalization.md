## 03 DISCUSSION FOR DEFINING GLOBALIZATION

For the discussion itself, I want you to choose one or two of the web links to analyze in relationship to the five definitions.  There are two main ways to think about this. 


  "The Alternative's alternative"  

  I am assuming that the westernization variant of globalization is used since the entire article details problems and solutions that have been created by social networks and there connection to democracy. 
  
  In summary the article details the rather new concept of "networked protest" in which different social networks have connected people of similar minds. This has resulted in many different demonstrations, protests, and other events that have causes social unrest in different countries across the globe.  
  
  The critical point that is made in the article is that this "networked protest" has magnified the amount of people involved. It has also resulted in "group think" like behavior where people are often only receiving like mind opinions of things they already think. Often magnifying the issue/topic that is being discussed into something that is "widely supported". This new style of protest has also increase the amount of radical opinions since people are hearing more similar opinions being shared. 

  These events have caused a negative perception of western social networks and how they connect people to cause social unrest. This in turn is causing more aggregation in the social networks to help control what they are causing. This would be considered reformist behavior since globalization is still seen as a good thing but just needs regulation. 

  Overall I find the author to be in the reformist category as well. They often stated in the article that news "outlets did try to aggregate some of this content" but failed even though it was "needed so badly". They also pointed out that the act of social connection has had many good factors in countries that were being oppressed so this out ways the negatives that have happened.
