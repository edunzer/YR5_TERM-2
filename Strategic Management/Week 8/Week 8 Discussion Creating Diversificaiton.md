## WEEK 8 DISCUSSION CREATING DIVERSIFICATION

In 400 words discuss the following:

- Based on the above listing, would you say that Nestle and/or Walt Disney's business lineup reflects a strategy of related diversification, unrelated diversification, or a combination of related and unrelated diversification?  
- What benefits are generated from any strategic fit existing between these corporations' businesses?
- Also, what types of companies should Walt Disney and/or Nestle consider acquiring that might improve shareholder value?
- Share another example of a company that uses one of the diversification strategies.  Do they use a related, unrelated or mixed strategy?  
- Explain your answers.

Nestle employs a strategy of related diversification, since many of the goods that they offer are related to food products. They are in almost all sections of major food and continue to create new creative brands to this day. This allows them to consider acquiring competitors with alternative items that could be used to expand there line of products. In order to corner the market even future they could start branching out from just food to actual supplier companies that could be used as a form of vertical integration. This would enable them to have more control over there competitors since they would own a large portion of supply chain needed in the industry. 

Walt Disney has a combination of related and unrelated diversification. It has many entertainment products mostly in the movie industry, but over time they have acquired other avenues of entertainment like broadcasting networks like ESPN, FOX, National Geographic, etc. that have put them in a whole new category. They have also branched out of technical entertainment and created theme parks to create another avenue of in person entertainment.  

Another company example of unrelated diversification could be P&G who owns lots of companies that could be considered competitors in there own market segment. If you look as a whole P&G owns companies that all revolve around care whether that be baby care, fabric, family, feminine, grooming, etc. But all of these are different market segments on there own which P&G has put together and assumed control of. One interesting example is that they own downy, tide, gain and tide all of which are considered and presented as competitors in there "fabric care" market segment.
