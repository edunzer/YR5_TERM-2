## WEEK 9 | DISCUSSION | CSR & ETHICS

As a business student, this is not the first time you have heard of corporate social responsibility and ethics.  In 400 words, discuss the following:

- More and more companies have adopted CSR initiatives.  While some companies have founded their mission and strategy based on their CSR and ethics, we also know that some have been pressured to get on board the CSR bandwagon.  Be sure to watch the Weekly Overview video.   For example, if you look at the history of Wal-Mart over the years, it really was quite recently that they adopted a more CSR stance.  What are your thoughts regarding a company that takes on CSR initiatives that is not really part of their overall mission?  Is it valid and necessary in today's consumer environment?  Or is it just a marketing ploy?  
- Micheal Porter, the famous business theorist that we have been following, has stated that the fundamental responsibility of business is to make a profit.  Is that true, or should business in society give back in some way?
- Lastly, in your BSG company, how have you approached the CSR and ethical decisions?  Was it part of your strategy or did it help you get ahead?


CSR is becoming an increasingly important aspect of business for highly visible companies like Wal-Mart, with this statement being magnified by companies that have so much value in there image. Since the public is becoming increasingly conscious and aware of CSR type issues company's like Wal-Mart have to "try" and be above profit in order to maintain there image that they have recently built up in the last 10 years. CSR was certainly not as important years ago when walmart and other large companies were building to there current size, but since more businesses have increased there CSR initiatives Walmart has as well. 

Whether they made these changes because of pressure from there customers and other businesses or because they "care" is up for debate but there bottom line is that they want to change to fit what the customer wants from them. I think any large company needs to adopt CSR initiatives for this reason, even if it's not part of their overall mission in order to stay competitive in the market. 

I have not approached any CSR activities or change decisions in my company because they really didn't seem to have a large effect. If they did have a large effect like loosing ability to sell in certain countries then I would of course adapt to that new market just like most large US companies are today in order to maintain there market position.
