## Week 3 Discussion Five Forces Competitive Theory

In 400 words, research ONE of the following industries and analyze using the 5-forces model:

Coffee
Soft Drinks
Cell Phones
Wearable Electronics (i.e. Apple Watch)

Please research the industry that you analyze and be sure to reference your sources.  You must reference at least one source.  

`Wearable Electronics (i.e. Apple Watch)`

Buyers: I would say the buy bargaining ability really depends on the scenario. Currently I would say that the buyers of apple products, that are also loyal to the brand, have very little power in the price. They are locked into that brand if they have more then 1 device and switching becomes a huge hassle since apple doesn't make it easy. Now if you are not locked into the apple brand then your ability to bargain increases 10x because most other smart watch makers have enabled use between brands which means you have lots of options. 

Substitute products: As far as alternative products go the big three producers Apple, Samsung, and Garmin (Price, 2021) already have cornered there different sections of this market. The only section that all of those companies above haven't taken is the "budget"/"bargain" portion of the smart watch market. But despite this they have master there product and tailored it to work only in there area of the market. For example apple watches are the best smart watches for users of other apple products. Samsung does the same. Garmin is the best at sport, travel, and exploration watches and there other products help with that. So substitutes would have to be high developed with those three areas in order to compete on the same level.  

Suppliers: Since no one smart watch is the same the supplier's ability to bargain between different companies is great. A supplier for raw materials of smart watches has a large amount of pull if they are one of the few that can support these large companies. Sames goes for a supplier of the software that goes onto these devices. For example Garmin could be outsourcing more of there software creation since they are not as focused on this as apple and Samsung already are. This creates a potential reliance on any company trying to break into the smart watch market who doesn't have in-house software creating abilities. 

New Entry: Right now there are only 3 main smart watch makers. Apple, Samsung, and Garmin. These were already large companies before they released there own smart watch and they have only grown since. This means that it will take much more time to develop a competitor to these companies that are so imbedded in the market already. So for those large companies there is very little threat to entrants since they already have so much control in the market. 

Rivalry: Right now the rivalry between those 3 companies above is a fight between including the "basic" features of a smart watch along with including great integration with there own products. For example Apple needs to have all these new features like tap-to-pay which was first developed by google first in there smart watches, but in order to help there section of the market they need to be loyal to there customer base. So making a smart watch that works best with there own products would be most important to keeping there existing customers from changing to a competitor.
