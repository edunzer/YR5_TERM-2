   - Operating profit margin
   - Return on total assets
   - Current ratio
   - Working capital
   - Long-term debt-to-capital

2. What hard evidence from your reports can you cite that indicates your company's strategy is working fairly well or perhaps not working so well?

3. What internal strengths and weaknesses does your company have?  (Be sure to apply the concepts from the textbook (chpt 4) to your company)

4. What external market opportunities for growth and increase profitability exist for your company?  How about external threats?  (Again, be sure to apply the concepts from the textbook (chpt 3) to your company.)

5. How would you specifically define your core competencies?

6. What are the key elements of your company's value chain?  Refer to Figure 4.1 in developing your answer.
