## WEEK 5 | DISCUSSION | FIVE GENERIC COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES 

In 300-400 words, based on the video and chapter 5, discuss the following:

Identify the competitive strategy used by five of the following restaurants. Keep in mind that some of them do more than serve food, however, focus on the food (which might need to be in relation to the other products they offer). Also, provide your rational. Choose Five:

McDonald’s
Hooters
In and Out Burger
Olive Garden
Chipotle
7-eleven
Chipotle
Hilton Hotels
In and Out Burger
Costco
Bonefish Grill
Chuck E Cheese

First ill choose In and Out Burger which uses a strategy where the company wants to service an large amount of customers form a small amount of select locations. They are also focused on maintaining a low-cost sustainable long-term business model. These factors suggest that the In and Out Burger is aiming for a Cost Focused approach by using a narrow and low cost overall business strategy behind well known brand name.

Second is 7-eleven which looks at providing various services at their numerous stores to differentiate themselves from the competition. Some off these offerings come in the form of fast meals, health products, and even the option to submit tax returns in some states. The main strategy for the business is that the offer a similar product line up in every store which makes there locations a common thought for many of there traveling customers. This makes there wide range of locations stand out from the competition that don't offer this same level of consistency. This makes there strategy Overall Differentiation focused. 

Third ill pick Costco who uses a strategy that is designed to focus on a large range of products given in bulk discounts to offset the competitive market prices of similar product. They also use a membership system which allows them control over customers access along with creating a locked door feel to the business that can attract customers who don't have access and want to. This segmentation of the company’s current and potential customer base cerate's more desire to unlock the new market of lower bulk prices being offered by Costco and no one else. This makes there strategy Overall Cost Leadership since they are also a very popular and successful international brand and are viewed highly by regions that do not contain a location.

Forth is Chipotle who uses a strategy that aims to capture a narrow market segment by providing quality  Mexican-fusion inspired food delivered to the customer through takeout, delivery, drive-thru. This strategy means that they would be within the Differentiation Focus section of the five competitive strategies. Using this strategy gives Chipotle the ability to reach their target market by having a small amount of  competitors who provide products to customers looking for Mexican-fusion food. This strategy also relates to the “blue ocean strategy” in our text where a company gains advantage by inventing a new distinct market segment. Chipotle's approach of business strategy where they have created a niche style of quality and speed Mexican eating allows them to maintain there current market position. 

Fifth ill pick McDonald’s who uses a strategy where the company wants to provide a wide range of services to a growing market. They also aim to provide low cost products to this large market by using there known brand name and regional location dominance. This makes there strategy Overall Cost where the strategy is dependent on there popularity, diverse regional products, and there hold on the currently expanding market segment.
