## WEEK 6 | DISCUSSION | OFFENSIVE VS DEFENSIVE STRATEGY: NETFLIX VS REDBOX VS BLOCKBOSTER

After reviewing chapter 6, and researching a bit about Netflix, Redbox and Blockbuster (also Netflix case below) compare and contrast the company strategies.  Keep in mind the topic from chapter 6 - Offensive and Defensive strategies.  Now keep in mind that these cases and the video above are a few years old.  But now you have the perspective when discussing the following (400 words):

- Considering the Offensive and Defensive strategies (from Chapter 6), discuss how these companies have used these approaches in developing their strategies.  
- How have these strategies played out over the last few years?  Have they kept on track, or have they changed direction?  

Your answer should show your ability to understand and incorporate the concepts from your textbook.  Please cite your sources, including the textbook.  

First Ill start with Blockbuster who "was" using the offensive strategy for a while. They were at the top of movie rentals and were using there large size to compete with others and offer better deals, exclusive content, etc. but then streaming started and they quickly had to be on the defensive and try to break through to that market. As we know they never did and thus was the end of Blockbuster. There failed defensive response being the reason for there demise. 

Next we have Redbox which is currently using the defensive strategy as well. They are very similar to Blockbuster but because of there differentiating business model and low overhead with no physical locations (stores) they have lasted longer. There current market dominance of the dvd rental market and there low prices allows more time before they crater like blockbuster. 

Lastly there is NetFlix who is using the offensive strategy to achieve there competitive advantage in there market. Although they completely wiped most movie rental/purchasing companies off the playing field there new market of streaming has new players that are continuing to grow. Netflix should be switching to a defensive strategy in the future as new streaming giants like disney have deep pockets that are allowing them to purchase there way to the top.
