## Week 1 | Discussion | What is Strategy? - Industry 1

Introduce yourself by telling us a bit about yourself

`Hi my name is Ethan. I am a senior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. I am currently working at Opus agency as a Salesforce Admin.`

`As far as information about me, I grew up in Lake Oswego (Portland) and moved to Bend 4 years ago then just recently moved back into the Portland area. You can probably guess that I like computers based on my major but I also like working on my car, cooking, and home improvement projects.`

Based on these videos and differing perspectives, what do we mean by strategy in today's business world?

`Strategy is a set of values to questions to define what the business does or aims to do to succeed. These questions are most commonly: what the business does?, what the business has?, what enables the business to outperform there competitors?, etc.`

Utilizing Kryscynski (Links to an external site.)'s four questions, apply them to a well know business that you are familiar with:
- Where does the business compete?
  `Opus Agency is a event planning business that aims to plan large scale events for tech organizations. This means that they compete in the event planning industry for most large organizations.`
- What unique value does it bring?
  `The current unique value that Opus has is there ability to mold themselves to different types of events. The company has absorbed two other smaller companies that specialize in certain areas. One of those areas was remote event creation. Having these other partnered companies allows opus to provide services to a wide range of businesses despite them wanting different types of events. Most competitors would have to outsource in order to do this which always creates added costs, and communication breakdowns that could result in loss of quality.`
- What resources and capabilities does it utilize?
  `Right now the resources that Opus specializes in is man power. As said above we have 2 other partnered companies that work with us along with just having lots of in-house event coordinators. This means that our capabilities are better then most since we can take on much more than other agencies and therefore never loose out because we cant support an event.`
- How does it sustain its value?
  `The company maintains and increases its market position in two important ways. First it offers something different then competitors which was described above, Secondly the company is continuing to grow which enables them to evolve with the industry. many event planning businesses took a huge dive when Covid struck but opus managed to pivot to all remote events and has now unlocked a new sector of business that they previously were not in. This was all possible because of the merging with small agencies that specialize in that industry.`

Lastly, considering you will spend the term running a business through the "BSG Simulation"  what are some things that you might need to consider as you create your strategy for your business?  In other words, what will be some of the challenges you might face?

`The biggest thing that I can think of is that in order to be at the top I would need to do something different then everyone else that would enable me to perform better. This could be any number of things but I cant follow the same structure that everyone else is I will need to develop a different strategy that works in the industry that is assigned. `
